# Project Name: Online Reservation System for "Royal Inn and Suites"

## Overview
This project is an online reservation system for "Royal Inn and Suites," a popular hotel located in the Midwest. The primary goal of this project is to develop a project using the aspnet core framework and the MVC design pattern.

## Solution Details
The online reservation form is designed to have controls that accept the data points listed in the table below. The primary operations include:

1. The user enters data for each input option.
2. The user data is stored in a C-sharp model (a C-sharp class).
3. Data validation like that used in FutureValue is included for each data item.
4. Once all data is entered, the user selects a "submit" button, and the reservation data is displayed on the screen in a separate view (e.g., the post view).

## Additional Considerations
The platform is developed on the ASP.NET Core framework, following an MVC design. Data is stored in and retrieved from a C# model.

## Fields
The following fields are required in the online reservation form:

1. Name
2. Email
